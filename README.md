# task50

![](https://i.imgur.com/9dFEzyF.jpg)

task50 is a minimal & elegant to-do list to help you get stuff done. This project was my first ever full project, made for CS50 2020 final project. Used HTML, CSS, JS (with JQuery). It is available [on my website here](https://pixel.is-a.dev/task50).

I recently redid most of its functionality and design after having a lot more experience in web development, now it saves tasks to localStorage and restores them later.

To run locally, just `git clone` this repo, then open `index.html`.
